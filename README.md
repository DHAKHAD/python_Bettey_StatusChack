Project Summary:
This project analyzes Li-ion battery aging using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data. 
The goal is to visualize impedance changes over battery life cycles, perform Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA),
and train a machine learning model to predict battery capacity based on EIS measurements.

Workflow:
1. Load and preprocess battery data.
2. Generate 3D visualization of impedance characteristics over aging cycles.
3. Compute and plot Incremental Capacity Analysis (dQ/dV vs Voltage).
4. Train and evaluate a predictive model for battery capacity estimation.
